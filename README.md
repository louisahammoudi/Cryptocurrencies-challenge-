## Overview 
This project implements unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis for prospective clients preparing to dive into the cryptocurrency market.

To provide clarification on the crypto universe to our client, we must create a report that includes the current cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how these currencies can be grouped together to create a classification system for the new investment portfolio.
